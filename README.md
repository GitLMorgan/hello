You can learn more about Markdown here - and you can also create a link automatically like this - https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf 
## More about Markdown
First, the simple stuff: *This is Italic* **This is Bold**
You can also create unordered lists:
* Item 1* Item 2* Item 3
And also ordered lists (of course):  1. Item 12. Item 23. Item 3   * Item 3a   * Item 3b
## Task Lists
Can be handy to keep track of things to do:
- [x] Task one is done- [x] Task two is done- [x] Task three is done- [ ] This task is not yet done
## Code Blocks
Are easy; just open and close with three backticks.
```javascriptvar first    var name    first = name = prompt("Enter new name, or OK to end")    while (name != "" && name != null) {     if (name < first)  first = name     name = prompt("Enter new name, or OK to end")    }    document.write("
 First name alphabetically = " + first)
